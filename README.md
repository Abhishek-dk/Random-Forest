# Random-Forest
## What is a Random Forest Algorithm?
- Random forest is a Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm that is used widely in Classification and Regression problems.
- It builds decision trees on different samples and takes their majority vote for classification and average in case of regression.
- Random Forest is a classifier that contains a number of decision trees on various subsets of the given dataset and takes the average to improve the predictive accuracy of that dataset.
- The greater number of trees in the forest leads to higher accuracy and prevents the problem of overfitting.
- It is a graphical representation for getting all the possible solutions to a problem/decision based on given conditions.
